<!-- # Company -->

<!--
  **This is your company page**. It should not focus on a specific product, but present your whole company. The journalists won't, most of the time, know you or your studio. With this page, you will have an opportunity to show your people, your work, your history and your contributions in a standard format. This is not a replacement for your website, but a quick way for the press to know you faster.

  If you don't have a `data.xml` yet, the easiest way to start is to run this command in your presskit folder:

  ```bash
  presskit new -t company
  ```

  Then, open the generated `data.xml` file and fill the blanks while following this guide.

  Okay… ready? Let's do this.

  <hr>

  For your products' `data.xml`, [refer to the product documentation](../product/).

  <hr>
-->

<!-- Don't forget to set your XML header correctly. -->
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

<!--
  Use a `<company>` tag for your main `data.xml` file. **It will be the root page of your presskit.**

  <!-- ## Description & History -->

  <!-- The description is a simple short block to describe your company or studio. Be brief. -->
  <description>
    Small, student based team making games.
  </description>

  <!--
    Tell your story with the `<history>` tag.

    You have two possibilities here.

    - Use an `<histories>` block like in the example.
    - Or use a single `<history>` block if you don't have much to say.

    You can't have both.

    Example of a single block:

    ```xml
    <history>
      Hello, world.
    </history>
    ```

      <text>Swing around as a space squid battling a fleet of robot packed spaceships in an effort to save your Starfish species. Find the best ways to infiltrate each ship, overcome their advanced technology, free your captured species, and get out before the whole place explodes.

      <header>About the game</header>
      <text>Dawn of the Celestialpod is a physics based, 2D, action RPG where you become a space squid.</text>
    </history>
	<history>
	  <header>Gameplay</header>
	  <text>At the core of Celestialpod is a unique physics based tentacle system that allows you to swing, pull, and grab your way through rigorous challenges. Every ship poses new tests where you’ll need to master the use of your tentacles in order to stand a chance. The robots will do anything they can to keep harvesting the Starfish, and will constantly invent new enemies to prevent you from rescuing them. Overcome the hostile environments inside the ships of the robotic fleet and destroy them from the inside out!</text>
	</history>
	<history>
	  <header>The Story</header>
	  <text>Starting out as a Starfish yourself, one day a robotic fleet appears above your planet. In mere seconds they descend, capturing every Starfish on the surface. While you’re locked in one of the cages another Starfish somehow manages to escape and frees you. The two of you make it outside, but the defense system of the ship notices and takes aim. Your savior sees the danger and, in an act of self-sacrifice, pushes you out of the way just in time. As they perish, the Starfish leaves you their remaining power. The influx of Starfish energy changes your very DNA, turning you into a Squid-like creature. With their sacrifice fresh in your mind you charge towards the fleet, determined to save the rest of the Starfish! // Defeat robotic enemies reminiscent of forgotten species and discover the chilling reality of what could befall your friends.</text>

	<history>
	  <header>A little about how this started</header>
	  <text>Dawn of the Celestialpod started development in early September 2017 as part of a Student Capstone project. Over the next couple of months we built out and expanded upon the original concept. At the end of the semester we presented to the campus faculty and game studio cohort in an effort to move on to Senior Production. We’re here because we made it through that challenge. Going forward we’re planning on releasing the game Q2 2018 after the semester. Our next big milestone is a Mid-Term Milestone where the game will be feature complete, due early March. Soon after we’ll enter into Alpha, and quickly polish up various aspects to get into Beta. Along the way we’ll be sharing about our development process and keeping people updated through multiple channels.</text>

  <!-- ## Team & Contacts -->

  <!--
    This is for your people.

    Add yourself, of course, but also your **frequent** collaborators for example.

    If a collaborator has only worked on one product, add her/him on this product page instead.

    The `<role>` tag can be anything you want. But we recommend to, at least, put the company name for the founders/employees. This will distinguish this person from the external collaborators.

    The `<website>` tag is optional.
